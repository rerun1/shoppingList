#### Create shopping list with javascript arrays
#### _**by Suzi Rubino â€” August 9th, 2019**_

## Description
Website with form that allows a user to input items they need at the store.
When the user submits the form, the form is hidden a list of items in alphabetical order, all uppercased, is displayed.

Hint: To do this, build an array of the inputted items. (Make sure you don't include any blank fields.) Sort the array in alphabetical order. Make a new array with each entry uppercased (don't just uppercase them when you display them). Then, display the sorted list of things as list items inside a <ul>.

## Objectives
- [x] JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- [x] Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).

- [x] Application implements a for loop and works as expected.
All previous objectives have been met.
- [x] Project is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
- [x] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- [x] Practice styling with imagery and fonts
